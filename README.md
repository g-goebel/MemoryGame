## Installation

## Usage
Open file "index.html" in browser, the "Matching Game" should appear
The game starts as soon as the first tile is clicked and the timer starts.
The goal is to find all matching pairs of cards. If more and more not matching pairs are clicked, the rating goes from three stars down to two and then to one.
If all pairs are found, the player gets a rating based on time needed and number of stars. So the challenge is to find all pairs with just few mismatches as quick as possible.

The best three players appear in the list below the field, the list is stored persistantly in the local storage and can be deleted via the "Delete ranking"-button.

The game can be resetted with with the reset button next to the time above the game field.
